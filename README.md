# Batchcamp

A browser extension to bulk download your purchases from Bandcamp

## Why would you want this?

There isn't an easy way to download your collection and purchases on Bandcamp. You have to click through to another page, wait for something behind the scenes to generate the link, then download it, then repeat for each one. Plus you can only download so many at once before you start to get rate limit errors.

Batchcamp will handle all of this for you and makes it as simple as selecting some checkboxes and hitting download

This extension is useful if you:

- Buy many releases on Bandcamp Fridays or full artist/label discographies
- Want to download your collection again in a different format
- Had a storage failure and need to re-download everything

## Features

- Adds a checkbox to each release on your collection and purchase pages: select multiple and hit the Download button!
- Options menu lets you set the download format & number of concurrent downloads

## Installation

Batchcamp is available to install in one click for

- [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/batchcamp/jfcffbaekgnenlohblfgpohgdhalgjeb)
- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/batchcamp/)

Compiled Chrome and Firefox releases: [HERE](https://github.com/hyphmongo/batchcamp/RELEASES) 

Or to manually build and install from source:

```

npm install

npm run build-chrome

```

## Big Room Tech House DJ Tool - TIP(s)!

If Chrome keeps popping up and asking you where to save each download: open up your Chrome settings, search for **Ask where to save each file before downloading** and toggle it off

Multi selecting works using the Shift key. To select everything in your Collection scroll all the way down and keep scrolling until you have loaded everything. Hold down your Shift key and check the final item in the list. This should select everything
